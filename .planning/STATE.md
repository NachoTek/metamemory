## Note on Widget Foundation

A widget foundation was built ahead of schedule as exploration code. This code exists in `src/meetandread/widgets/` but does **not** count toward Phase 5 completion. The widget will be properly planned and executed when Phase 5 begins per the roadmap.

## Active Phase

**Phase 2: Real-Time Transcription Engine** ◐ **IN PROGRESS**

**Goal:** Integrate Whisper models for real-time transcription with < 2s latency

**Requirements (10):**
- [✓] TRAN-01: Load Whisper model for real-time transcription (WhisperTranscriptionEngine complete)
- [✓] TRAN-02: Chunk audio for < 2s transcription latency (VADChunkingProcessor with 1.0s min chunk)
- [✓] TRAN-03: Extract confidence scores from transcription (confidence.py complete)
- [✓] TRAN-04: Color-code transcript by confidence (widget displays words with confidence colors)
- [✓] TRAN-05: Continuous transcription without lag accumulation (AudioRingBuffer with trimming)
- [✓] TRAN-06: Format transcript for AI agent consumption (markdown export with timestamps)
- [✓] CFG-02: Select model size (tiny/base/small) via settings panel UI
- [✓] CFG-05: Display hardware capabilities (HardwareDetector complete)
- [✓] CFG-06: Recommend model size based on hardware (ModelRecommender complete)
- [✓] CFG-07: Settings persist across restarts (ConfigManager complete)

**Completed Plans:**
- [✓] 02-01: Core transcription engine with faster-whisper, VAD chunking, local agreement buffer
- [✓] 02-02: Settings persistence with JSON storage, versioning, smart defaults
- [✓] 02-03: Confidence scoring & hardware detection with model recommendations
- [✓] 02-04: Integration & UI wiring (streaming pipeline, widget display, settings panel)

**Success Criteria:**
1. ✅ User can start recording and capture clean audio from selected source(s)
2. ✅ Audio streams to disk simultaneously with transcription processing
3. ✅ Recording can be stopped and audio file is complete and playable
4. ✅ FakeAudioModule successfully injects pre-recorded audio for testing
5. ✅ System captures both microphone and system audio when "both" selected
6. ✅ No audio dropouts or corruption during 30+ minute recordings
