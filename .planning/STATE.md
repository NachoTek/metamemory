## Note on Widget Foundation

A widget foundation was built ahead of schedule as exploration code. This code exists in `src/meetandread/widgets/` but does **not** count toward Phase 5 completion. The widget will be properly planned and executed when Phase 5 begins per the roadmap.

**Success Criteria:**
1. ✅ User can start recording and capture clean audio from selected source(s)
2. ✅ Audio streams to disk simultaneously with transcription processing
3. ✅ Recording can be stopped and audio file is complete and playable
4. ✅ FakeAudioModule successfully injects pre-recorded audio for testing
5. ✅ System captures both microphone and system audio when "both" selected
6. ✅ No audio dropouts or corruption during 30+ minute recordings

**Notes:**
- Phase 2 gaps updated: Settings panel and clean exit resolved by user
- Gap 3 (transcript repetition) remains - requires further investigation
- System audio loopback requires Windows Core Audio implementation (planned for Phase 4)
- PortAudio WASAPI loopback symbol not exported in sounddevice binary
- **Gap Closure 02-05 Complete:** PyTorch DLL issue resolved via whisper.cpp replacement

## Next Actions

**Immediate:**
1. ⏳ Execute Phase 2 gap closure 02-12:
   - 02-12: Fix duplicate lines after silence bug

**Ready to Start:**
- Phase 3: Dual-Mode Enhancement Architecture (after checkpoint approval)

**Upcoming:**
- Phase 4: Speaker Identification (includes Core Audio loopback completion)
- Phase 5: Widget Interface & System Integration

**Deferred:**
- Windows Core Audio loopback for system capture (AUD-02 completion → Phase 4)
