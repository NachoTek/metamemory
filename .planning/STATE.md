## Note on Widget Foundation

A widget foundation was built ahead of schedule as exploration code. This code exists in `src/meetandread/widgets/` but does **not** count toward Phase 5 completion. The widget will be properly planned and executed when Phase 5 begins per the roadmap.

## Active Phase

**Phase 1: Audio Capture Foundation**

**Goal:** Establish reliable audio capture from microphone and system audio using Windows WASAPI

**Requirements (8):**
- [✓] AUD-01: Capture microphone input (MicSource implemented, gap closures applied)
- [◐] AUD-02: Capture system audio output (SystemSource interface, needs Core Audio impl)
- [✓] AUD-03: Capture microphone and system audio simultaneously (AudioSession supports dual-source)
- [✓] AUD-04: Select audio source(s) before recording starts (SessionConfig with SourceConfig)
- [✓] AUD-05: Start and stop recording with single-click actions (AudioSession.start/stop, stop ordering fixed)
- [◐] AUD-06: Capture audio using Windows 11 WASAPI endpoints (WASAPI detection working)
- [✓] AUD-07: Stream audio to disk during recording for crash recovery (PCM streaming, false positive fixed)
- [✓] AUD-08: Test system can inject pre-recorded audio via FakeAudioModule (Complete, endless looping fixed)

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can start recording and capture clean audio from selected source(s)
2. Audio streams to disk simultaneously with transcription processing
3. Recording can be stopped and audio file is complete and playable
4. FakeAudioModule successfully injects pre-recorded audio for testing
5. System captures both microphone and system audio when "both" selected
6. No audio dropouts or corruption during 30+ minute recordings

## Blockers

None currently.

**Notes:**
- System audio loopback requires Windows Core Audio implementation (planned for future phase)
- PortAudio WASAPI loopback symbol not exported in sounddevice binary
- Phase 1 core requirements met: mic capture, disk streaming, crash recovery all verified

---

## Next Actions

**Immediate:**
1. ✅ Phase 1 Complete with Gap Closures - Ready for Phase 2
2. Gap closures completed:
   - 01-05: FakeAudioModule endless looping fixed
   - 01-06: Widget double-click requirement fixed  
   - 01-07: Widget lobe single-click verified
   - 01-08: Crash recovery false positive fixed

**Upcoming:**
- Phase 2: Real-Time Transcription Engine (Whisper integration)
  - Whisper model loading and inference
  - Real-time audio chunking (< 2s latency)
  - Confidence scoring and formatting
- Phase 3: Conversation State Management
- Phase 5: System Tray Widget (production UI)

**Deferred:**
- Windows Core Audio loopback for system capture (AUD-02 completion)
