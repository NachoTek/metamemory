# Roadmap: meetandread

**Created:** 2026-01-31
**Requirements:** 68 v1 requirements | 0 v2 requirements
**Phases:** 6 phases for MVP completion

---

## Phase 1: Audio Capture Foundation

**Goal:** Establish reliable audio capture from microphone and system audio using Windows WASAPI

**Requirements:** AUD-01, AUD-02, AUD-03, AUD-04, AUD-05, AUD-06, AUD-07, AUD-08

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can start recording and capture clean audio from selected source(s)
2. Audio streams to disk simultaneously with transcription processing
3. Recording can be stopped and audio file is complete and playable
4. FakeAudioModule successfully injects pre-recorded audio for testing
5. System captures both microphone and system audio when "both" selected
6. No audio dropouts or corruption during 30+ minute recordings

**Phase Context:**
This phase establishes the foundation. Without reliable audio capture, nothing else works. The WASAPI integration must handle Windows 11 audio routing, device selection, and format configuration. FakeAudioModule enables development and testing without requiring real meetings.

**Technical Focus:**
- WASAPI backend implementation for Windows 11
- Audio device enumeration and selection
- Audio format configuration (sample rate, bit depth, channels)
- Simultaneous multi-source capture
- Streaming audio to disk for crash recovery
- FakeAudioModule for test audio injection

## Phase 2: Real-Time Transcription Engine

**Goal:** Integrate Whisper models for real-time transcription with < 2s latency

**Requirements:** TRAN-01, TRAN-02, TRAN-03, TRAN-04, TRAN-05, TRAN-06, CFG-02, CFG-05, CFG-06, CFG-07

**Success Criteria:**
1. Transcription text appears within 2 seconds of speech
2. Continuous transcription sustains without lag accumulation during 30+ minute sessions
3. Confidence scores calculated and color-coded correctly
4. Hardware detection recommends appropriate model sizes
5. Small model (tiny/base/small) runs without system degradation
6. Settings persist across application restarts

**Phase Context:**
Build the core transcription pipeline. Whisper integration requires model loading, audio chunking, inference optimization, and result formatting. The system must maintain real-time performance while managing system resources.

**Technical Focus:**
- Whisper model integration (tiny/base/small)
- Audio chunking and buffering strategy
- Real-time inference pipeline
- Confidence score extraction from Whisper
- Color-coding logic for confidence levels
- Hardware detection (RAM, CPU, GPU)
- Model size recommendations based on hardware
- Settings persistence

## Phase 3: Dual-Mode Enhancement Architecture

**Goal:** Implement background large model enhancement with selective processing and live UI updates

**Requirements:** ENH-01, ENH-02, ENH-03, ENH-04, ENH-05, ENH-06, ENH-07, ENH-08, CFG-01, CFG-03, CFG-04, TST-01, TST-02, TST-03, ENH-09, ENH-10

**Success Criteria:**
1. Low-confidence segments (< 70%) are queued for large model enhancement
2. Enhancement workers process segments in parallel without blocking real-time transcription
3. Transcript updates in real-time as enhanced segments complete
4. Enhanced segments display in bold for visual distinction
5. Enhancement completes within 15-30 seconds after recording stops
6. FakeAudioModule validates dual-mode shows accuracy improvement vs single-mode
7. User can adjust workers and confidence threshold during operation
8. System resource usage remains acceptable during dual-mode operation

**Phase Context:**
The core innovation — dual-mode parallel enhancement. This is make-or-break for the product differentiation. The Go/No-Go decision after testing will determine if this complexity is justified.

**Technical Focus:**
- Large Whisper model integration (medium/large)
- Worker pool management for background processing
- Selective enhancement queue (confidence-based filtering)
- Live transcript update mechanism
- Bold formatting for enhanced segments

**Requirements:** SPK-01, SPK-02, SPK-03, SPK-04, SPK-05, SPK-06, SPK-07, SPK-08, TST-05

**Success Criteria:**
1. System detects 3+ distinct speakers within single conversation
2. User can pin transcript segments to specific people
3. Voice signatures are generated from pinned segments
4. Signatures persist across application restarts
5. System identifies known speakers in subsequent recordings with 90%+ accuracy
6. Confidence visualization shows speaker identification certainty
7. Voice signature database is portable and backup-friendly

**Phase Context:**
Speaker diarization provides critical context for downstream AI agents. Knowing who said what transforms transcripts from raw text to actionable intelligence.

**Technical Focus:**
- pyannote.audio integration for X-vector embeddings
- Speaker diarization within recordings
- Voice signature generation from pinned segments
- Persistent voice signature database

**Success Criteria:**
1. Windows 11 Fluent Design UI is functional and responsive
2. Record/Stop controls work intuitively
3. Audio source selection is clear and functional
4. Real-time transcript display shows text with confidence colors
5. System tray integration provides quick access to controls
6. Right-click menu functions correctly
7. Multi-monitor support works for transcript window placement
8. Transcripts save correctly with timestamps and speaker labels
9. Recording list displays saved transcripts
10. Transcript format is optimized for AI agent consumption

**Phase Context:**
The user interface must be functional but doesn't need polish for MVP. Windows 11 Fluent Design provides the visual foundation. System tray integration is critical for the "invisible infrastructure" experience.

**Technical Focus:**
- PyQt6/PySide6 Windows 11 Fluent Design implementation
- Main application window layout
- Real-time transcript display widget

## Dependencies

**Critical Path:**
1. Phase 1 (Audio) → Phase 2 (Transcription) → Phase 3 (Enhancement) → Phase 6 (Validation)
2. Phase 2 (Transcription) → Phase 4 (Speaker ID) → Phase 5 (UI)
3. Phase 3 (Enhancement) → Phase 5 (UI) - UI must show enhancement updates

**Independent Phases:**
- Phase 5 UI development can begin once transcription architecture is defined (mid-Phase 2)
- Phase 4 Speaker ID can begin once audio pipeline is stable (end of Phase 1)

**Go/No-Go Decision Point:**
- After Phase 3 completion and 1-2 weeks testing in Phase 6
- If dual-mode shows no accuracy improvement OR unacceptable performance: remove enhancement, fallback to single-mode

**Medium Risk: Voice signature re-identification accuracy**
