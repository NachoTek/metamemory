**Created:** 2026-01-31
**Requirements:** 93 v1 requirements | 0 v2 requirements
**Phases:** 6 phases for MVP completion

---

## Phase 1: Audio Capture Foundation

**Goal:** Establish reliable audio capture from microphone and system audio using Windows WASAPI

**Requirements:** AUD-01, AUD-02, AUD-03, AUD-04, AUD-05, AUD-06, AUD-07, AUD-08

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can start recording and capture clean audio from selected source(s)
2. Audio streams to disk simultaneously with transcription processing
3. Recording can be stopped and audio file is complete and playable
4. FakeAudioModule successfully injects pre-recorded audio for testing
5. System captures both microphone and system audio when "both" selected
6. No audio dropouts or corruption during 30+ minute recordings

**Phase Context:**
This phase establishes the foundation. Without reliable audio capture, nothing else works. The WASAPI integration must handle Windows 11 audio routing, device selection, and format configuration. FakeAudioModule enables development and testing without requiring real meetings.

**Technical Focus:**
- WASAPI backend implementation for Windows 11
- Audio device enumeration and selection
- Audio format configuration (sample rate, bit depth, channels)
- Simultaneous multi-source capture
- Streaming audio to disk for crash recovery
- FakeAudioModule for test audio injection

**Plans:** 8 plans (4 original + 4 gap closure)

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md - Audio storage + crash-safe streaming writer
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md - WASAPI capture backends + device probing + FakeAudioSource
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md - Recording session manager + automated fake-audio tests
- [x] 01-04-PLAN.md - Widget wiring + crash recovery UX + manual verification
- [ ] 01-05-PLAN.md - Fix FakeAudioModule endless looping
- [ ] 01-06-PLAN.md - Fix widget double-click requirement
- [ ] 01-07-PLAN.md - Verify widget lobes single-click (covered by 01-06)
- [ ] 01-08-PLAN.md - Fix crash recovery false positive

**Status:** 🔄 Gap Closure (2026-02-01)
- Original 4 plans complete and verified

3. Confidence scores calculated and color-coded correctly
4. Hardware detection recommends appropriate model sizes
5. Small model (tiny/base/small) runs without system degradation
6. Settings persist across application restarts

**Phase Context:**
Build the core transcription pipeline. Whisper integration requires model loading, audio chunking, inference optimization, and result formatting. The system must maintain real-time performance while managing system resources.

**Technical Focus:**
- Whisper model integration (tiny/base/small)
- Audio chunking and buffering strategy
- Real-time inference pipeline
- Confidence score extraction from Whisper
- Color-coding logic for confidence levels

**Success Criteria:**
1. Low-confidence segments (< 70%) are queued for large model enhancement
2. Enhancement workers process segments in parallel without blocking real-time transcription
3. Transcript updates in real-time as enhanced segments complete
4. Enhanced segments display in bold for visual distinction
5. Enhancement completes within 15-30 seconds after recording stops
6. FakeAudioModule validates dual-mode shows accuracy improvement vs single-mode
7. User can adjust workers and confidence threshold during operation
8. System resource usage remains acceptable during dual-mode operation

**Phase Context:**
The core innovation — dual-mode parallel enhancement. This is make-or-break for the product differentiation. The Go/No-Go decision after testing will determine if this complexity is justified.

2. Widget remains always-on-top and draggable to any position
3. Snap-to-edges behavior works within 20px of screen edges
4. Widget shows 4/5ths when docked to edge
5. Record button displays correct visual states: idle (translucent glass), recording (glowing red pulse), processing (swirling animation)
6. Audio input toggle lobes function correctly and show active/inactive states
7. Transcript panel flows out from widget as integrated component (not separate window)
8. Transcript panel auto-expands when recording starts and can be manually collapsed
9. Chat-style transcript displays speaker names with unique colors per speaker
10. Unknown speakers show sequential numbering (Unknown Speaker 1, 2, etc.)
11. Transcript auto-scrolls with 10-second pause on manual scroll
12. Confidence color coding displays correctly on transcript text
13. Enhanced segments (from dual-mode) display in bold formatting

**Phase Context:**
The widget interface is a departure from traditional desktop applications. It must feel like a cohesive integrated component rather than separate floating windows. The widget body (record button) with attached lobes creates a unique visual metaphor that needs careful implementation. The transcript panel must flow organically from the widget, maintaining the illusion of a single unified interface element. Visual states must communicate clearly without being distracting.

**Technical Focus:**
- PyQt6/PySide6 borderless frameless window implementation
- Custom widget painting for translucent glass effects
- Animation framework for pulse and swirl effects
- Drag and drop with snap-to-edge logic

## Dependencies

**Critical Path:**
1. Phase 1 (Audio) → Phase 2 (Transcription) → Phase 3 (Enhancement) → Phase 6 (Validation)
2. Phase 2 (Transcription) → Phase 4 (Speaker ID) → Phase 5 (UI)
3. Phase 3 (Enhancement) → Phase 5 (UI) - UI must show enhancement updates

**Independent Phases:**
- Phase 5 UI development can begin once transcription architecture is defined (mid-Phase 2)
- Phase 4 Speaker ID can begin once audio pipeline is stable (end of Phase 1)

**Go/No-Go Decision Point:**
- After Phase 3 completion and 1-2 weeks testing in Phase 6
- If dual-mode shows no accuracy improvement OR unacceptable performance: remove enhancement, fallback to single-mode
