## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Cloud transcription services | Local-only architecture is core value proposition |
| Real-time chat features | Out of scope for transcription tool |
| Video recording | Audio-only transcription focus |
| Mobile app | Desktop-only for MVP |
| Automatic speaker ID without pinning | Manual pinning ensures accuracy before auto-ID |
| Advanced UI polish | Functional Windows 11 UI for MVP |
| Calendar integration | Workflow integration deferred to post-MVP |
| Direct AI agent integration | meetandread is input layer only |
| Search functionality | Downstream AI agent handles retrieval |
| Startup at login | Nice-to-have for post-MVP |
| Automatic updates | Manual download for MVP |
| Business system integrations | Handled by downstream AI agent |
| Voice signature sharing between users | Privacy concerns; deferred |
