# T04: Plan 04

**# Phase 1 Plan 4: Widget Integration Summary**

## What Happened

# Phase 1 Plan 4: Widget Integration Summary

**RecordingController with non-blocking finalization, widget-driven mic/system/both capture, and startup crash recovery prompt.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-01T16:27:02Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-01T16:31:40Z
- **Tasks:** 2 auto tasks completed (checkpoint pending)
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments

- RecordingController as UI-friendly wrapper around AudioSession
- Non-blocking stop/finalize via worker thread (prevents UI freeze)
- Clear error state with ControllerError for UI display
- Widget integration: record button wired to controller
- Source selection via mic/system toggle lobes
- Visual error indicator when no source selected
- Startup recovery prompt for partial recordings
- Recovery runs in worker thread with progress dialog

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: RecordingController and widget wiring** - `89fcfd8` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Startup crash recovery prompt** - `49d7e63` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/metamemory/recording/__init__.py` - Recording module exports
- `src/metamemory/recording/controller.py` - UI-friendly controller with worker thread
- `src/metamemory/widgets/main_widget.py` - Widget wired to controller, error indicator
- `src/metamemory/main.py` - Startup recovery prompt

## Decisions Made

- RecordingController wraps AudioSession to provide UI-friendly API with callbacks
- Non-blocking stop via worker thread prevents UI freezing during finalization
- Error indicator is visual-only (QGraphicsRectItem) - no modal dialogs for normal flow
- Startup recovery runs synchronously before widget appears
- Declining recovery preserves .pcm.part files (safer default - user data)

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed SystemSource invalid channels error**

- **Found during:** Checkpoint testing (user reported error)
- **Issue:** SystemSource tried to open InputStream on output device, causing "Invalid number of channels" error
- **Fix:** SystemSource now raises clear AudioSourceError explaining Windows Core Audio is required
- **Files modified:** src/metamemory/audio/capture/sounddevice_source.py
- **Verification:** SystemSource now provides helpful error message directing to mic-only recording
- **Committed in:** 02deebe (deviation fix)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 bug)
**Impact on plan:** System audio capture requires Windows Core Audio implementation (planned for future). Mic-only recording works correctly.

## Issues Encountered

- **System audio capture limitation:** WASAPI loopback requires Windows Core Audio API (pycaw/comtypes), not sounddevice's PortAudio. SystemSource now provides clear error message. Mic-only recording is fully functional.
- **Test isolation issue:** test_session_reuse occasionally fails when run with full suite (FileExistsError), but passes when run individually. Pre-existing issue, not related to current changes.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Checkpoint Status

**✅ CHECKPOINT APPROVED** - Manual verification completed 2026-02-01

**Note:** System audio capture requires Windows Core Audio implementation (planned for future). Mic-only recording fully verified.

Verification results:
- ✅ Mic-only recording (10 seconds) - **PASSED**
- ⏸️ System-only recording (10 seconds) - **BLOCKED (needs Windows Core Audio)**
- ⏸️ Both sources recording (short segment) - **BLOCKED (needs Windows Core Audio)**
- ✅ Crash recovery simulation - **PASSED**
- ✅ Long-run stability (30+ minute, mic-only) - **PASSED**

## Next Phase Readiness

- Widget-driven recording complete
- Recovery UX implemented
- Ready for manual verification to validate Phase 1 success criteria
- After verification: Phase 1 complete, ready for Phase 2 (Transcription Engine)

### Blockers

- Manual verification pending (checkpoint)
