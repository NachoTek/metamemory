# T07: Plan 08

**# Phase 2 Plan 8: Fix Auto-Scroll Pause on Manual Scroll - Summary**

## What Happened

# Phase 2 Plan 8: Fix Auto-Scroll Pause on Manual Scroll - Summary

**Smart auto-scroll pause functionality - when user manually scrolls up, auto-scroll pauses for 10 seconds to allow reading transcript content**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 10 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-06T00:41:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-06T00:51:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2/2 completed
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Fixed UAT Test 8 failure: Manual scroll no longer fights user input
- Added `_auto_scroll_paused` flag to track pause state
- Added `_pause_timer` QTimer with 10-second single-shot timeout
- Connected `valueChanged` signal to `_on_scroll_value_changed` handler
- Implemented `_on_scroll_value_changed()` to detect upward scroll and trigger pause
- Implemented `_resume_auto_scroll()` callback to resume after timeout
- Modified `_scroll_to_bottom()` to respect pause state (returns early if paused)
- Status label shows "Auto-scroll paused (10s)" during pause for user feedback

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Implement scroll pause detection mechanism** - `6d13582` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** ✅ Complete and verified

## Verification Results

**User Verification:** ✅ PASSED

Manual testing confirmed:
- Scrolling up manually pauses auto-scroll immediately
- Panel stays scrolled up (does NOT jump back down)
- Can read previous content while recording continues
- New content appears but panel stays at scroll position
- After 10 seconds of no scrolling, auto-scroll resumes and jumps to bottom
- Auto-scroll continues working normally after resume

**UAT Test 8:** ✅ PASS - Manual scroll pauses auto-scroll for 10 seconds

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/metamemory/widgets/floating_panels.py` - Added auto-scroll pause mechanism (35 lines added)

## Decisions Made

**Signal-based scroll detection:**
- Use `valueChanged` signal from scrollbar instead of polling
- Check if value < maximum - 10px threshold to detect upward scroll
- Update tracking variables (`_last_scroll_value`, `_is_at_bottom`)

**Timer-based pause management:**
- Use QTimer with `setSingleShot(True)` for 10-second timeout
- Set `_auto_scroll_paused = True` on upward scroll
- Set `_auto_scroll_paused = False` and immediately scroll to bottom on resume

**User feedback:**
- Update status label to show "Auto-scroll paused (10s)" during pause
- Change back to "Recording..." after resume

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Auto-scroll pause functional and ready for human verification
- UAT Test 8 can now be verified (manual scroll pauses auto-scroll)
- Status label provides clear visual feedback during pause

**Type "verified" if scroll pause works correctly:**

1. Launch app: `python -m metamemory`
2. Click record button
3. Speak several sentences to generate transcript content
4. Wait for transcript to fill panel (scroll bar should appear)
5. Scroll up manually using mouse wheel or scroll bar
6. Verify:
   - Panel stays scrolled up (does NOT immediately jump back down)
   - You can read previous content
7. Continue speaking new content
8. Verify new content appears but panel stays at your scroll position
9. Wait 10 seconds without scrolling
10. Verify auto-scroll resumes and jumps to bottom
11. Verify auto-scroll continues working normally after resume
