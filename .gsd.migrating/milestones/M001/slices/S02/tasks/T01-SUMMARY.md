# T01: Plan 01

**# Phase 2 Plan 1: Core Transcription Engine Summary**

## What Happened

# Phase 2 Plan 1: Core Transcription Engine Summary

**Real-time transcription engine with faster-whisper integration, VAD-based chunking, and local agreement buffer for <2s latency.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 14 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-02T01:14:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-02T01:28:15Z
- **Tasks:** 6/6 completed
- **Files modified:** 7

## Accomplishments

- **faster-whisper integration** - 4x faster than openai-whisper with same accuracy
- **AudioRingBuffer** - Thread-safe ring buffer with automatic trimming at 16kHz float32
- **VADChunkingProcessor** - Intelligent chunking with 1.0s minimum, speech-end detection
- **LocalAgreementBuffer** - Prevents text flickering with agreement_threshold=2
- **WhisperTranscriptionEngine** - Complete inference wrapper with confidence scoring
- **Integration tests** - 19 tests covering all components including actual model loading

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Install faster-whisper** - `62e808b` (chore)
2. **Task 2: AudioRingBuffer** - `78b30ae` (feat)
3. **Task 3: VADChunkingProcessor** - `4b9a04b` (feat)
4. **Task 4: LocalAgreementBuffer** - `235ab50` (feat)
5. **Task 5: WhisperTranscriptionEngine** - `df32d82` (feat)
6. **Task 6: Integration tests** - `e796de9` (test)

**Plan metadata:** [to be committed]

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/metamemory/transcription/__init__.py` - Module exports
- `src/metamemory/transcription/engine.py` - WhisperTranscriptionEngine with confidence
- `src/metamemory/transcription/audio_buffer.py` - AudioRingBuffer with thread-safety
- `src/metamemory/transcription/vad_processor.py` - VADChunkingProcessor with min-chunk
- `src/metamemory/transcription/local_agreement.py` - LocalAgreementBuffer for deduplication
- `tests/test_transcription_engine.py` - 19 integration tests
- `requirements.txt` - Added faster-whisper, torch, torchaudio

## Decisions Made

- **faster-whisper over openai-whisper** - 4x speed improvement essential for <2s latency
- **Agreement threshold of 2** - Balance between responsiveness and stability
- **Min chunk size 1.0s** - Research shows this is optimal for accuracy vs latency
- **Confidence normalization** - Linear mapping from Whisper log_prob to 0-100 scale
- **Thread-safe buffers** - Locking for concurrent access from audio capture thread

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed LocalAgreementBuffer divergence handling**

- **Found during:** Task 4 testing
- **Issue:** When content diverged to shorter common prefix, last_commit_len wasn't adjusted, preventing future commits
- **Fix:** Reset _last_commit_len to len(common) when buffer shortens after divergence
- **Files modified:** src/metamemory/transcription/local_agreement.py
- **Verification:** test_divergence_resets_agreement now passes
- **Committed in:** 235ab50

**2. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed LocalAgreementBuffer extension commitment timing**

- **Found during:** Task 4 testing
- **Issue:** Extensions were being committed immediately due to stable_len updating before commit check
- **Fix:** Delay stable_len update until after commit check for exact matches
- **Files modified:** src/metamemory/transcription/local_agreement.py
- **Verification:** test_extension_needs_fresh_agreement now passes
- **Committed in:** 235ab50

---

**Total deviations:** 2 auto-fixed (both Rule 1 - Bug)
**Impact on plan:** Both fixes essential for correct local agreement behavior. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

1. **LocalAgreementBuffer algorithm complexity** - Required multiple iterations to get the agreement/commit timing correct. The interaction between divergence, extension, and commitment required careful state tracking.

2. **Test Unicode encoding** - Checkmark characters caused encoding errors on Windows console. Fixed by using "OK" prefix instead.

3. **VAD processor speech end flag** - The is_speech_end() flag resets in get_chunk(), so it must be checked before getting the chunk. Documented in tests.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required. Whisper model downloads automatically from HuggingFace on first use.

## Next Phase Readiness

### Ready for Phase 2 Plan 2:
- Transcription engine foundation complete
- All core components tested and working
- Model loading verified with tiny model

### Blockers:
None. Ready to proceed to settings persistence (02-02).
