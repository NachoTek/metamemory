# T11: Plan 12

**## Phase 2 Plan 12 Summary**

## What Happened

## Phase 2 Plan 12 Summary

**Fix variable bug causing duplicate lines after silence**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-10T14:22:10Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-10T14:25:10Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Fixed line 386 to use local `phrase_start` variable instead of `self._new_phrase_started` in deduplication code path
- Verified fix with Python import and source inspection
- Committed atomic fix

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Fix line 386 in deduplication path to use local phrase_start variable** - `ba4d1ab` (correct fix)

**Plan metadata:** `fa69f3f` (docs: complete plan)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/metamemory/transcription/accumulating_processor.py` - Fixed line 386 in deduplication path to use local phrase_start variable (was incorrectly using self._new_phrase_started)

## Decisions Made

None - plan executed exactly as specified.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**Issue:** Plan specified fixing line 412, but actual bug was on line 386 in deduplication code path.

**Discovery:** User reported issue still occurring after initial fix. Investigation revealed TWO code paths in `_transcribe_accumulated`:
1. Lines 357-391: Deduplication path (active during live transcription)
2. Lines 401-433: Full emission path (fallback)

The bug on line 386 used `self._new_phrase_started` (already reset to False) instead of local `phrase_start` variable.

**Resolution:** Fixed line 386 to use `phrase_start` variable.

**Total deviations:** 1 discovered and fixed.

**Impact on plan:** Fix location corrected, functionality now correct.

## Issues Encountered

**Critical Bug Location Error:**
- Initial fix targeted line 412 (fallback path) but actual bug was on line 386 (deduplication path)
- User reported issue persisted after initial fix
- Investigation revealed deduplication code path (lines 357-391) was the active path during live transcription
- Corrected fix applied to line 386
- **User verified:** Fix works correctly — phrases now separate with empty lines after silence

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

Gap closure 02-12 complete. Ready for verification checkpoint.
