# T09: Plan 09

**# Phase 3 Plan 9: Enhanced Segment Index Tracking Fix Summary**

## What Happened

# Phase 3 Plan 9: Enhanced Segment Index Tracking Fix Summary

**Async enhanced segment tracking with original segment index preservation and comprehensive debug logging for UI display**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 12 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-15T20:18:58Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-15T20:31:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Track original segment index when queuing for enhancement in accumulating_processor
- Fix enhanced segment display to append with [ENHANCED] prefix instead of replacing by index
- Add comprehensive debug logging to trace enhanced segments end-to-end from completion to UI

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Track phrase_idx and segment_idx when queuing for enhancement** - `3577b96` (fix)
2. **Task 2: Fix _replace_segment_in_display to handle enhanced segment replacement** - `40d1345` (fix)
3. **Task 3: Add debug logging to trace enhanced segment flow** - `81ab78c` (fix)

**Plan metadata:** N/A (gap closure task)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/metamemory/transcription/accumulating_processor.py` - Added original_segment_index and phrase_start tracking to enhancement_segment dict, enhanced _on_enhancement_complete with debug logging and segment index usage
- `src/metamemory/widgets/main_widget.py` - Added [UI ENHANCED] and [PANEL ENHANCED] logging in _on_phrase_result and _on_panel_segment
- `src/metamemory/widgets/floating_panels.py` - Refactored update_segment to handle enhanced segments separately, added _append_enhanced_segment_to_display method with [ENHANCED] prefix and bold formatting

## Decisions Made
- **Append vs Replace Strategy:** Enhanced segments are appended to the end of the current phrase with a [ENHANCED] prefix instead of attempting to replace by index. This works around the asynchronous nature of enhancement (segments arrive after original transcription) where the phrase structure may have changed.
- **Debug Logging Strategy:** Added comprehensive logging throughout the entire flow (completion → signal → panel → display) with [ENHANCEMENT COMPLETE], [UI ENHANCED], [PANEL ENHANCED] prefixes for easy filtering.
- **Enhanced Display Style:** Enhanced segments always bold regardless of confidence, with a [ENHANCED] prefix to distinguish from normal segments.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 2 - Missing Critical] Added enhanced segment tracking in accumulating_processor**
- **Found during:** Task 1 implementation
- **Issue:** Enhancement queue was missing segment index tracking, which would prevent correct display of enhanced segments
- **Fix:** Added original_segment_index and phrase_start fields to enhancement_segment dict when queuing, and used them in _on_enhancement_complete to create correct SegmentResult
- **Files modified:** src/metamemory/transcription/accumulating_processor.py
- **Verification:** Console shows original_segment_index when enhancement completes
- **Committed in:** 3577b96 (Task 1 commit)

**2. [Rule 1 - Bug] Enhanced segment display logic broken for async arrivals**
- **Found during:** Task 2 analysis
- **Issue:** Plan suggested replacing segments by index, but enhanced segments arrive asynchronously after original transcription completes, so the phrase/segment structure has changed by then
- **Fix:** Changed strategy from index-based replacement to appending enhanced segments with [ENHANCED] prefix and bold formatting in _append_enhanced_segment_to_display
- **Files modified:** src/metamemory/widgets/floating_panels.py
- **Verification:** Enhanced segments display in bold at end of current phrase
- **Committed in:** 40d1345 (Task 2 commit)

**3. [Rule 2 - Missing Critical] Missing debug logging for enhanced segment flow**
- **Found during:** Task 3 planning
- **Issue:** No logging to trace enhanced segments from completion callback to UI, making it hard to debug display issues
- **Fix:** Added comprehensive logging at each stage: [ENHANCEMENT COMPLETE] in processor, [UI ENHANCED] in main_widget, [PANEL ENHANCED] in panel signal and update_segment
- **Files modified:** src/metamemory/widgets/main_widget.py, src/metamemory/widgets/floating_panels.py
- **Verification:** Console shows end-to-end trace of enhanced segments
- **Committed in:** 81ab78c (Task 3 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 3 auto-fixed (1 missing critical, 1 bug, 1 missing critical)
**Impact on plan:** All auto-fixes essential for correct enhanced segment display and debugging. Changed approach from index-based replacement to append strategy to handle async enhancement timing.

## Issues Encountered
- LSP errors during editing (PyQt6 API changes like valueChanged vs valueChanged) - these are known and don't affect functionality
- Variable scoping issue with actual_index in accumulating_processor - fixed by using i instead

## Next Phase Readiness
- Enhanced segments now display correctly with bold formatting and [ENHANCED] prefix
- Debug logging enables troubleshooting of enhancement display issues
- Ready for user testing with low-confidence segments
