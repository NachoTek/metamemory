"""Local agreement buffer for transcription deduplication.

Prevents text flickering and duplication in streaming transcription by only
committing text after N consecutive iterations agree on the same content.

Based on whisper_streaming implementation pattern.

class LocalAgreementBuffer:
    """Buffer that prevents text flickering through local agreement policy.
    
    Instead of emitting text immediately (which causes flickering), this buffer
    tracks recent transcriptions and only commits text when N consecutive
    iterations produce the same prefix. This stabilizes streaming output.
    
    The algorithm works by:
    1. Maintaining a buffer of the current agreed-upon text
    2. Finding common prefix between buffer and each new transcription
    3. Tracking how many consecutive iterations have agreed on each position
    4. Only committing text that has been stable for N iterations
    
    Key insight: When new content is added (buffer grows), that new content
    must survive N iterations of exact matching before being committed.

    Example:
        buffer = LocalAgreementBuffer(agreement_threshold=2)
        
        # Build agreement on base text
        buffer.process_iteration('Hello world')  # Buffer: 'Hello world'
        buffer.process_iteration('Hello world')  # Agreement: 1
        buffer.process_iteration('Hello world')  # Agreement: 2 -> commit 'Hello world'
        
        # Extension needs fresh agreement
        buffer.process_iteration('Hello world today')  # Buffer extends, reset
        buffer.process_iteration('Hello world today')  # Agreement: 1
        buffer.process_iteration('Hello world today')  # Agreement: 2 -> commit ' today'
